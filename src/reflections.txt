Relationship to what we do

One thing that I really took away from the recent work that I've done with Observables is the flexibility that it affords us

Knowledge of the different operators that are less commonly used -> we can start building things in terms of how a system should make sense

search functionality

1. something tells me to initiate lookup

2. i then want to start getting initial search information
2. i may also want to start timer here
2. i may be running concurrent searches here
2. i may set up listeners (like we do in iframe)

3. search is complete, i may want a listener to push out the results
3. i may want to combine results from different streams that I've split apart
3. i'll want to end the search timer if i'm using it for logging, or it may even be the trigger that ends all my searches

4. 


Distinctness
Tabs, Verticals, Unique Searches

Benefits of Distinctness in our system
Dealing with particular searches, particular users, particular sites

Rajesh said before - none of the things we're doing with other sites are a given
We're not guaranteed a contract, which can be added to our design
